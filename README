Minimalistic WP Theme based on Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate. 

I developed this theme for my needs. The reasons is that I needed a theme which only makes us of WP as a CMS - not as a Blog. And I added the wonderful HTML5 Boilerplate stuff to it.

In fact it is really nothing special, but I didn't find any template that only had the very basic setup of a Wordpress theme including HTML5 Boilerplate. So if you have similar needs you can just copy this and use it as a starting point for your own WP Theme based on HTML5 Boilerplate.
